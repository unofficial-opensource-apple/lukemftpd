     ffttppdd..ccoonnff - ftpd(8) configuration file

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The ffttppdd..ccoonnff file specifies various configuration options for ftpd(8)
     that apply once a user has authenticated their connection.

     ffttppdd..ccoonnff consists of a series of lines, each of which may contain a con-
     figuration directive, a comment, or a blank line.  Directives that appear
     later in the file override settings by previous directives.  This allows
     `wildcard' entries to define defaults, and then have class-specific over-
     rides.

     A directive line has the format:
           command class [arguments]

     A ``\'' is the escape character; it can be used to escape the meaning of
     the comment character, or if it is the last character on a line, extends
     a configuration directive across multiple lines.  A ``#'' is the comment
     character, and all characters from it to the end of line are ignored (un-
     less it is escaped with the escape character).

     Each authenticated user is a member of a _c_l_a_s_s, which is determined by
     ftpusers(5).  _c_l_a_s_s is used to determine which ffttppdd..ccoonnff entries apply to
     the user.  The following special classes exist when parsing entries in
     ffttppdd..ccoonnff:
           aallll     Matches any class.
           nnoonnee    Matches no class.

     Each class has a type, which may be one of:

           GGUUEESSTT   Guests (as per the ``anonymous'' and ``ftp'' logins).  A
                   chroot(2) is performed after login.

           CCHHRROOOOTT  chroot(2)ed users (as per ftpchroot(5)).  A chroot(2) is
                   performed after login.

           RREEAALL    Normal users.

     The ftpd(8) SSTTAATT command will return the class settings for the current
     user as defined by ffttppdd..ccoonnff.

     Each configuration line may be one of:

     aaddvveerrttiissee _c_l_a_s_s _h_o_s_t
           Set the address to advertise in the response to the PPAASSVV and LLPPSSVV
           commands to the address for _h_o_s_t (which may be either a host name
           or IP address).  This may be useful in some firewall configura-
           tions, although many ftp clients may not work if the address being
           advertised is different to the address that they've connected to.
           If _c_l_a_s_s is ``none'' or no argument is given, disable this.

     cchheecckkppoorrttccmmdd _c_l_a_s_s [ooffff]
           Check the PPOORRTT command for validity.  The PPOORRTT command will fail if
           the IP address specified does not match the FTP command connection,
           or if the remote TCP port number is less than IPPORT_RESERVED.  It
           is _s_t_r_o_n_g_l_y encouraged that this option be used, espcially for
           sites concerned with potential security problems with FTP bounce
           attacks.  If _c_l_a_s_s is ``none'' or ooffff is given, disable this fea-
           ture, otherwise enable it.

     cchhrroooott _c_l_a_s_s [ppaatthhffoorrmmaatt]
           If _p_a_t_h_f_o_r_m_a_t is not given or _c_l_a_s_s is ``none'', use the default
           behaviour (see below).  Otherwise, _p_a_t_h_f_o_r_m_a_t is parsed to create a
           directory to create as the root directory with chroot(2) into upon
           login.

           _p_a_t_h_f_o_r_m_a_t can contain the following escape strings:
                 EEssccaappee  DDeessccrriippttiioonn
                 %c      Class name.
                 %d      Home directory of user.
                 %u      User name.
                 %%      A ``%'' character.

           The default root directory is:
                 CCHHRROOOOTT  The user's home directory.
                 GGUUEESSTT   If --aa _a_n_o_n_d_i_r is given, use _a_n_o_n_d_i_r, otherwise the
                         home directory of the `ftp' user.
                 RREEAALL    By default no chroot(2) is performed.

     ccllaassssttyyppee _c_l_a_s_s _t_y_p_e
           Set the class type of _c_l_a_s_s to _t_y_p_e (see above).

     ccoonnvveerrssiioonn _c_l_a_s_s _s_u_f_f_i_x [_t_y_p_e _d_i_s_a_b_l_e _c_o_m_m_a_n_d]
           Define an automatic in-line file conversion.  If a file to retrieve
           ends in _s_u_f_f_i_x, and a real file (sans _s_u_f_f_i_x) exists, then the out-
           put of _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is returned instead of the contents of the file.

                 _s_u_f_f_i_x   The suffix to initiate the conversion.

                 _t_y_p_e     A list of valid filetypes for the conversion.  Valid
                          types are: `f' (file), and `d' (directory).

                 _d_i_s_a_b_l_e  The name of file that will prevent conversion if it
                          exists.  A file name of ``_.'' will prevent this dis-
                          abling action (i.e., the conversion is always per-
                          mitted.)

                 _c_o_m_m_a_n_d  The command to run for the conversion.  The first
                          word should be the full path name of the command, as
                          execv(3) is used to execute the command.  All in-
                          stances of the word ``%s'' in _c_o_m_m_a_n_d are replaced
                          with the requested file (sans _s_u_f_f_i_x).

           Conversion directives specified later in the file override earlier
           conversions with the same suffix.

     ddiissppllaayy _c_l_a_s_s [_f_i_l_e]
           If _f_i_l_e is not given or _c_l_a_s_s is ``none'', disable this.  Other-
           wise, each time the user enters a new directory, check if _f_i_l_e ex-
           ists, and if so, display its contents to the user.  Escape se-
           quences are supported; refer to _D_i_s_p_l_a_y _f_i_l_e _e_s_c_a_p_e _s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e_s in
           ftpd(8) for more information.

     hhoommeeddiirr _c_l_a_s_s [ppaatthhffoorrmmaatt]
           If _p_a_t_h_f_o_r_m_a_t is not given or _c_l_a_s_s is ``none'', use the default
           behaviour (see below).  Otherwise, _p_a_t_h_f_o_r_m_a_t is parsed to create a
           directory to change into upon login, and to use as the `home' di-
           rectory of the user for tilde expansion in pathnames, etc.
           _p_a_t_h_f_o_r_m_a_t is parsed as per the cchhrroooott directive.

           The default home directory is the home directory of the user for
           RREEAALL users, and _/ for GGUUEESSTT and CCHHRROOOOTT users.

     lliimmiitt _c_l_a_s_s _c_o_u_n_t [_f_i_l_e]
           Limit the maximum number of concurrent connections for _c_l_a_s_s to
           _c_o_u_n_t, with `0' meaning unlimited connections.  If the limit is ex-
           ceeded and _f_i_l_e is given, display its contents to the user.  If
           _c_l_a_s_s is ``none'' or _c_o_u_n_t is not specified, disable this.  If _f_i_l_e
           is a relative path, it will be searched for in _/_e_t_c (which can be
           overridden with --cc _c_o_n_f_d_i_r).

     mmaaxxffiilleessiizzee _c_l_a_s_s _s_i_z_e
           Set the maximum size of an uploaded file to _s_i_z_e.  If _c_l_a_s_s is
           ``none'' or no argument is given, disable this.

     mmaaxxttiimmeeoouutt _c_l_a_s_s _t_i_m_e
           Set the maximum timeout period that a client may request, default-
           ing to two hours.  This cannot be less than 30 seconds, or the val-
           ue for ttiimmeeoouutt.  If _c_l_a_s_s is ``none'' or _t_i_m_e is not specified, set
           to default of 2 hours.

     mmooddiiffyy _c_l_a_s_s [ooffff]
           If _c_l_a_s_s is ``none'' or ooffff is given, disable the following com-
           mands: CCHHMMOODD, DDEELLEE, MMKKDD, RRMMDD, RRNNFFRR, and UUMMAASSKK.  Otherwise, enable
           them.

     mmoottdd _c_l_a_s_s [_f_i_l_e]
           If _f_i_l_e is not given or _c_l_a_s_s is ``none'', disable this.  Other-
           wise, use _f_i_l_e as the message of the day file to display after lo-
           gin.  Escape sequences are supported; refer to _D_i_s_p_l_a_y _f_i_l_e _e_s_c_a_p_e
           _s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e_s in ftpd(8) for more information.  If _f_i_l_e is a relative
           path, it will be searched for in _/_e_t_c (which can be overridden with
           --cc _c_o_n_f_d_i_r).

     nnoottiiffyy _c_l_a_s_s [_f_i_l_e_g_l_o_b]
           If _f_i_l_e_g_l_o_b is not given or _c_l_a_s_s is ``none'', disable this.  Oth-
           erwise, each time the user enters a new directory, notify the user
           of any files matching _f_i_l_e_g_l_o_b.

     ppaassssiivvee _c_l_a_s_s [ooffff]
           If _c_l_a_s_s is ``none'' or ooffff is given, disallow passive (PPAASSVV, LLPPSSVV,
           and EEPPSSVV) connections.  Otherwise, enable them.

     ppoorrttrraannggee _c_l_a_s_s _m_i_n _m_a_x
           Set the range of port number which will be used for the passive da-
           ta port.  _m_a_x must be greater than _m_i_n, and both numbers must be be
           between IPPORT_RESERVED (1024) and 65535.  If _c_l_a_s_s is ``none'' or
           no arguments are given, disable this.

     rraatteeggeett _c_l_a_s_s _r_a_t_e
           Set the maximum get (RREETTRR) transfer rate throttle for _c_l_a_s_s to _r_a_t_e
           bytes per second.  If _r_a_t_e is 0, the throttle is disabled.  If
           _c_l_a_s_s is ``none'' or no arguments are given, disable this.

           An optional suffix may be provided, which changes the intrepreta-
           tion of _r_a_t_e as follows:
                 b    Causes no modification. (Default; optional)
                 k    Kilo; multiply the argument by 1024
                 m    Mega; multiply the argument by 1048576
                 g    Giga; multiply the argument by 1073741824
                 t    Tera; multiply the argument by 1099511627776

     rraatteeppuutt _c_l_a_s_s _r_a_t_e
           Set the maximum put (SSTTOORR) transfer rate throttle for _c_l_a_s_s to _r_a_t_e
           bytes per second, which is parsed as per rraatteeggeett _r_a_t_e.  If _c_l_a_s_s is
           ``none'' or no arguments are given, disable this.

     ssaanneennaammeess _c_l_a_s_s [ooffff]
           If _c_l_a_s_s is ``none'' or ooffff is given, allow uploaded file names to
           contain any characters valid for a file name.  Otherwise, only per-
           mit file names which don't start with a `.' and only comprise of
           characters from the set ``[-+,._A-Za-z0-9]''.

     tteemmppllaattee _c_l_a_s_s [_r_e_f_c_l_a_s_s]
           Define _r_e_f_c_l_a_s_s as the `template' for _c_l_a_s_s; any reference to
           _r_e_f_c_l_a_s_s in following directives will also apply to members of
           _c_l_a_s_s.  This is useful to define a template class so that other
           classes which are to share common attributes can be easily defined
           without unnecessary duplication.  There can be only one template
           defined at a time.  If _r_e_f_c_l_a_s_s is not given, disable the template
           for _c_l_a_s_s.

     ttiimmeeoouutt _c_l_a_s_s _t_i_m_e
           Set the inactivity timeout period.  (the default is fifteen min-
           utes).  This cannot be less than 30 seconds, or greater than the
           value for mmaaxxttiimmeeoouutt.  If _c_l_a_s_s is ``none'' or _t_i_m_e is not speci-
           fied, set to the default of 15 minutes.

     uummaasskk _c_l_a_s_s _u_m_a_s_k_v_a_l
           Set the umask to _u_m_a_s_k_v_a_l.  If _c_l_a_s_s is ``none'' or _u_m_a_s_k_v_a_l is not
           specified, set to the default of 027.

     uuppllooaadd _c_l_a_s_s [ooffff]
           If _c_l_a_s_s is ``none'' or ooffff is given, disable the following com-
           mands: AAPPPPEE, SSTTOORR, and SSTTOOUU, as well as the modify commands: CCHHMMOODD,
